# Off-Grid Survival List

Imagine all the world's servers explode tomorrow. What do you do? (Well, what should you HAVE done?)
This project is a small web page that lists everything you'd want on your PC *before* the internet disappears. Think of it as a knowledge time capsule.  

## Features

- Fully responsive Tailwind site  
- Cool animated circular text  
- Three major survival categories:
  - Knowledge & data archives (Wikipedia, WikiHow, OpenStreetMap, etc.)
  - Survival books and guides (US Army FM, FAO docs, Where There Is No Doctor...)
  - DIY & repair resources (OSE Wiki, Practical Electronics, StackExchange dumps)
- Silly tone, but (very) serious content 游때游땕

## Tech stack

- TailwindCSS
- HTML only (no JavaScript)  
- Preview image and meta tags for SEO  
- Hosted with uhhh

If the internet's gone, licenses probably won't matter anyway 游때游때游때游땕游땕
